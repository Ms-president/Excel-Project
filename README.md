# Bike Buyers Analysis with Excel

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of a dataset of potential bike buyers. Using Microsoft Excel, I performed data cleaning, created dynamic pivot tables, and built an interactive dashboard to uncover key insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior to identify factors that influence whether a customer will purchase a bike. The insights gained can be used to inform marketing strategies, sales initiatives, and product development.

## 📂 DataSet
- **bike_buyers.csv:** The original, raw dataset used for this analysis. This contains the customer demographics (age, gender, income, region)
  
- **working sheet.csv:** The cleaned and prepared dataset, ready for analysis, with new calculated columns.
  
- **pivot table.csv:** A sample of the pivot table outputs used to generate the dashboard charts.
  
- **Excel Project.xlsx:** The final Excel workbook containing all the data, pivot tables, and the interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Process
The cleaning process was done in the working sheet and included:
- ✅ Removing duplicates
- ✅ Handling missing values
- ✅ Standardizing text formats
- ✅ Correcting spelling/format inconsistencies
- ✅ Converting data types (e.g., text to numbers/dates)
- ✅ Creating calculated columns for further analysis

## 📊 Data Analysis
A pivot table was created to:
- Compare bike purchase trends by gender, age group, and region
- Analyze purchase behavior based on commute distance
- Summarize income levels vs. purchase decision

## 📈 Dashboard
- An interactive Excel dashboard was designed with:
- Filter slicers (Gender, Region, Age Group)
- Visualizations: Bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs
- Clean and user-friendly layout

## 🖼️ Project Workflow
- Import and explore raw data
- Clean and transform in the working sheet
- Build pivot tables for aggregated insights
- Create a dashboard for visual presentation

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & Visualizations
- Slicers & Filters

## 📌 Key Insights
The analysis revealed several interesting insights, including:
- A noticeable correlation between Commute Distance and bike purchasing behavior, with a higher number of buyers in the "0-1 Miles" range.
- The Middle Age demographic group showed the highest rate of bike purchases.
- An exploration of income versus gender showed different purchasing patterns for male and female buyers.
